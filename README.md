=========

Simple Website CMS to connect your Server to your Website.

------

Dependency:
===========
- Web Server (e.g. apache2/nginx/tomcat ..)
- PHP5
- MySQL
- Database Manager (e.g. PhpMyAdmin)
- SimpleAuth (Plugin NEW API)
- LoM-CMS Plugin Connector (will be dynamic, soon)

------

Short Description:
==================
LoM-CMS stands for Legend Of MCPE Content Management System.

The LoM-CMS would require all dependencies to be able to run the CMS. This would require basically a plugin connector that will transmit all datas needed from your server to the website. This plugin connector will be open and might not be uploaded to the PocketMine Forums Repository due to that you need to modify its code for your own needs like amount of kills, deaths, player statistics, account status and more. Its still being planned though.

This CMS is to help Server Owners who are planning to use Player data management through websites.
